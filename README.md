Add to the dictionary validFunc your function name then write your function like below
As of 10/7/20 validFunc is on line 66

def example(calc):
  global returnVariable
  if you want it to be just a single number:
    simpleArithmetic(calc)
    returnVariable = calc
 Now use the string you got and do your code.
 Make sure it still is a string and store in returnVariable
